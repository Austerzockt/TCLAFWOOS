# TCLAFWOOS (Short for: "That Crap Luxi and Fisch Wanted on Our Server"
This plugin basically began as a little side project for a planned private server (doesn't exist at the time of writing this)! 
Well, I wanted to make it good, so I invested quite some time into it, and now I am even considering splitting the API (and of course reworking it) from the Plugin and releasing it seperately
